      "content": "In what feels like a thousand years ago (although, in fact, it was October 2019), Headspace made a commitment to expand its offering beyond meditation. The preliminary prototype was sleek, inviting, feature-rich, and very, very different from what Headspace looked like at the time — especially in terms of technology. As a matter of fact, we were basically looking at a completely different application! The prospect of building out this new interface and feature set in less than a year was daunting to all of the engineering teams but for us droids, it seemed like a near impossible task. Why? Because our existing codebase was, to put it bluntly, a hot mess.",
